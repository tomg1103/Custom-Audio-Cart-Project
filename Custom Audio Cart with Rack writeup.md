# Custom Audio Cart Project, August 2022

### Goal: Design and build a custom audio cart, to replace and improve upon a hastily improvised solution

### Organization: The Lutheran Church of the Atonement, Barrington Illinois

## Summary of project:
 
I designed and built a custom audio cart to replace and improve upon a previously improvised solution, while staying ~30% under budget.

## Background: During the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, Atonement stopped holding services inside of the church to decrease the risk of spreading COVID-19.
After a summer of prerecorded services, we shifted to holding outdoor services. This required a mobile cart that could hold a soundboard, 2 QXLD4 receivers,
power distribution, and a FM transmitter. The improvised solution was to borrow a Rubbermaid cart used in the Church's kitchen. This solution worked, but was
unsightly, and did not allow for the QLXD4 receivers to be securely rack mounted, limiting the carts equipment capacity.


## Goals for the new cart:
 - Aesthetically pleasing design
     - While remaining easily accessible for maintenance
 - Locking casters
 - Durable and strong frame
 - Standard 19'' rack mount slots
 - Permanently mounted power distribution
 - Improved cable management
    - Internal passthrough to facilitate improved cable management
 - Flat top, no lip around edge to limit the size of usable equipment on top of the cart
   - The previous cart had a lip, such that a laptop could not be comfortably placed next to the soundboard
 - Storage for equipment 
 - Taller, comfortable to use while standing
 
## Budget

One of my duties as the Technical Director at Atonement was to manage the technical arts budget, which was used to fund projects, repairs, new equipment purchases, ect. 
I budgeted $200 from the technical arts budget to go towards materials and equipment for the cart, and ended up being ~30% under budget, spending ~$140

> (Careful consideration was taken when sourcing materials, and thanks to generous donations from community members, this project was able to stay well under budget.

## Sourcing a Base Cart:

A large enough cart was needed to base the design on, an outsourced custom cart, or a prebuilt mobile rack was considered, but due to budget constraints, 
was not a viable solution. 

Facebook marketplace was used to source a used cart, kitchen carts were fairly cheap and available in the Chicago area at the time. Several listings were not chosen because 
of the need to have enough space to mount a 19'' audio rack onto the cart, so carts with preinstalled cabinets would not be a good choice due to not being accessible from 
the back, and for not being wide enough to fit the rack.

An [Ikea Bror](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/bror-utility-cart-black-pine-plywood-60333850/) utility cart was available in like new condition for $100, while it traditionally retails for $200. It's steel frame construction and maximum load capacity of 110 lbs made this an excellent base for the project to be built upon. Additionally, it's preinstalled locking castors made it an appealing choice, as new castors would not need to be sourced and installed.

## Modifications:

### AV Rack Design:

To build the rack, plywood was determined to be a cheap and readily available solution, and easier to implement compared to other materials such as sheet metal. Additionally, plywood is a common material used when building AV cabinets in productions.

Plywood was sourced from a family friend who was giving away excess wood. Measurements were made, and a circular saw was used to cut the plywood down to size. Three pieces were cut, two to be installed on the bottom shelf, to hold brackets for the receiver rack, and an additional one to be placed along the back of the upper shelf, to keep stored items from falling from the back, and to help create a sleek look.

The plywood was lightly sanded, then 3 coats of spray primer was used to prime the plywood. After drying for 24 hours in a dry environment, the reverse side of the panel was primed, allowed to dry, and lightly sanded, and black semigloss spray paint was applied in the same fashion.

The top panel the cart came with was attached to the metal frame with several short screws. Several colors of water and oil-based stain was tested on a small section of the underside of the panel but was blotchy and created an undesirable appearance. Thus, the top panel was instead left unstained, and finished with a semigloss polyurethane spray to protect the work surface from abuse and to prevent water stains.  

### Plywood Installation:

The outer panel on the lower shelf was able to be attached using wood screws run through the pre-existing holes in the frame. A washer and split lock washer were used to keep the screw from loosening over time. 

Corner braces were used to install the second panel on the lower shelf 2 were installed on the bottom side, in between the 2 plywood panels where the rack was to be installed to create a cleaner look. Wood screws were used to fix the bracket to the plywood, and bolts were installed through drilled holes in the sheet metal shelf. An additional bracket was installed on the same panel, securing the plywood panel to the bottom of the second shelf. Loctite was used to secure the bolts and to keep vibrations from loosening them. 
### Curtain

In order to hide the unsightly cables on the backside of the rack, a curtain was designed and hung below the second shelf. A small curtain rod was hung above the plywood panels, and a custom curtain was designed and sewed to fit the cart. Pie weights were sewed into the bottom of the curtain to prevent the curtain from blowing around in a windy environment, as the cart is intended to be used outdoors. 

### Rack Installation:

[Standard Rack rails](https://www.amazon.com/Gator-Rackworks-Heavy-Steel-GRW-RACKRAIL-04U/dp/B0718XFY1Q/ref=sr_1_6?keywords=rack%2Bmount%2Brails&qid=1664490879&qu=eyJxc2MiOiI0LjQ3IiwicXNhIjoiMy45MiIsInFzcCI6IjMuNTkifQ%3D%3D&sr=8-6&th=1) were purchased from Amazon, and installed onto the previously installed plywood panels.

Fig. 7 Illustration of issue with accessibility to rack rail
The design of the frame was such that the corner of the frame would keep the mounting screws on one side of the rack from being easily accessible, so a strip of scrap plywood was cut, and painted so the rack rail would be offset from the plywood panel. This scrap was attached with screws and wood glue. 

The rails were recessed into the cart ~1 inch in order to protect equipment from being damaged during transportation, as well as to allow equipment with protruding controls to be installed in the future.

### Cable Management 

A power strip was installed on the inside of back panel on the upper shelf. This gave the cart a easily accessible power switch to easily power equipment on and off, and allowed for improved cable management.

## Cable Passthrough


For power and audio signal cables to be routed from the rack to the power strip and soundboard located on the upper shelves, a hole was drilled in the second shelf. A hole allows for a cleaner design, as cables running to other parts of the cart would have to run along the exterior of the cart to pass from a lower to upper shelf.

Due to the quantity and size of the cables required to use this passthrough, as well as tools available, a slot was determined to be the best design for the passthrough.

Fig. 10 A 2 1/8'' hole saw was used to cut the initial holes in the slot. 

A 2 1/8'' hole saw was used to cut the ends of the slot, and a Dremel with a rotary cutting disk was used to cut a tangent line between each hole, creating a slot. A center punch was used to create a divot where holes were to be drilled, in order to prevent the drill from walking away from the intended area and marring the shelf.

#### Waste Management 

As drilling through metal creates metal shavings, strips of tape were adhered to the sides of the shelf, overlapping such that metal shavings and dust on the shelf would stick to the tape, rather than falling off of the edge of the cart. A plastic bag was taped below where the slot was being cut to catch shavings that fell through the hole.

Fig. 13 Final install of grommet on the cart 


A grommet was designed to protect the cables from the sharp metal edges of the hole. The grommet was designed to be printed on a FDM 3d printer, allowing for multiple revisions to be prototyped quickly at a low price. 

The grommet was printed in PETG on a stock Creality Ender 3 Pro. It was installed by placing it into the slot, and using a lighter to soften the bottom edge of the grommet enough that a screwdriver could be used to push the soft plastic into the metal shelf. Once the plastic cooled, the grommet was constrained by the metal shelf, and would not shift out of place. 

### Final Wiring and setup

The equipment initially installed on the rack is as follows:
- 5 Shure ULXP4 receiver
- 1 Shure UA844 Active Antenna/Power distribution unit
- 1 16 channel Mackie Soundboard 

## Reflections, what would I do differently next time: 

 - Purchasing higher capacity rack rails would be beneficial. The current design has enough capacity for the time being, but 6 rack slots can fill up quickly with the addition of additional equipment, and larger brackets would have fit, and not been much more expensive.
 - To keep the curtain in place in the wind, magnets could have been sewn into the lower corners, rather than weighing the entire curtain down with pie weights. This would have been easier to implement.
