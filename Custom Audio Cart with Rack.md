# Custom Audio Cart Project, August 2022

### Goal: Design and build a custom audio cart, to replace and improve upon a hastily improvised solution

### Organization: The Lutheran Church of the Atonement, Barrington Illinois

Background: During the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, Atonement stopped holding services inside of the church to decrease the risk of spreading COVID-19.
After a summer of prerecorded services, we shifted to holding outdoor services. This required a mobile cart that could hold a soundboard, 2 QXLD4 receivers,
power distribution, and a FM transmitter. The improvised solution was to borrow a Rubbermaid cart used in the Church's kitchen. This solution worked, but was
unsightly, and did not allow for the QLXD4 receivers to be securly rack mounted, limiting the carts equipment capacity.



## Goals for the new cart:
 - Aesthetically pleasing design
     - While remaining easily accessible for maintenance
 - Locking casters
 - Durable and strong frame
 - Standard 19'' rack mount slots
 - Permanently mounted power distribution
 - Improved cable management
    - Internal passthrough to facilitate improved cable management
 - Flat top, no lip around edge to limit the size of usable equipment on top of the cart
   - The previous cart had a lip, such that a laptop could not be comfortably placed next to the soundboard
 - Storage for equipment
 
## Budget

One of my duties as the Technical Director at Atonement was to manage the technical arts budget, which was used to fund projects, repairs, new equipment purchases, ect. 
I budgeted $200 from the technical arts budget to go towards materials and equipment for the cart, and ended up being ~30% under budget, spending ~$140

> (Careful consideration was taken when sourcing materials, and thanks to generous donations from community members, this project was able to stay well under budget.

## Sourcing a Base Cart:

A large enough cart was needed to base the design on. A outsourced custom cart, or even a prebuilt mobile rack was considered, but due to budget constraints, 
was not a viable solution. 

Facebook marketplace was used to source a used cart, kitchen carts were fairly cheap and available in the Chicago area at the time. Several listings were not chosen because 
of the need to have enough space to mount a 19'' audio rack onto the cart, so carts with preinstalled cabinets would not be a good choice due to not being accessabel from 
the back, and for not being wide enough to fit the rack.
