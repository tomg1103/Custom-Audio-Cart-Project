# Custom Audio Cart Project, August 2022

### Goal: Design and build a custom audio cart, to replace and improve upon a hastily improvised solution

### Organization: The Lutheran Church of the Atonement, Barrington Illinois

Background: During the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, Atonement stopped holding services inside of the church to decrease the risk of spreading COVID-19.
After a summer of prerecorded services, we shifted to holding outdoor services. This required a mobile cart that could hold a soundboard, 2 QXLD4 receivers,
power distribution, and a FM transmitter. The improvised solution was to borrow a Rubbermaid cart used in the Church's kitchen. This solution worked, but was
unsightly, and did not allow for the QLXD4 receivers to be securly rack mounted, limiting the carts equipment capacity.



## Goals for the new cart:
 - Aesthetically pleasing design
     - While remaining easily accessible for maintenance
 - Locking casters
 - Durable and strong frame
 - Standard 19'' rack mount slots
 - Permanently mounted power distribution
 - Improved cable management
    - Internal passthrough to facilitate improved cable management
 - Flat top, no lip around edge to limit the size of usable equipment on top of the cart
   - The previous cart had a lip, such that a laptop could not be comfortably placed next to the soundboard
 - Storage for equipment
 
## Budget

One of my duties as the Technical Director at Atonement was to manage the technical arts budget, which was used to fund projects, repairs, new equipment purchases, ect. 
I budgeted $200 from the technical arts budget to go towards materials and equipment for the cart, and ended up being ~30% under budget, spending ~$140

> (Careful consideration was taken when sourcing materials, and thanks to generous donations from community members, this project was able to stay well under budget.

## Sourcing a Base Cart:

A large enough cart was needed to base the design on. A outsourced custom cart, or even a prebuilt mobile rack was considered, but due to budget constraints, 
was not a viable solution. 

Facebook marketplace was used to source a used cart, kitchen carts were fairly cheap and available in the Chicago area at the time. Several listings were not chosen because 
of the need to have enough space to mount a 19'' audio rack onto the cart, so carts with preinstalled cabinets would not be a good choice due to not being accessabel from 
the back, and for not being wide enough to fit the rack.

An [Ikea Bror](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/bror-utility-cart-black-pine-plywood-60333850/) utility cart was available in like new condition for $100, while it traditionally retails for $200. It's steel frame construction and maximum load capacity of 110 lbs made this an excellent base for the project to be built upon. Additionally, it's preinstalled locking castors made it an appealing choice, as new castors would not need to be sourced and installed.

## Modifications:

### Plywood:
Plywood was sourced from a family friend who was giving away excess wood. Measurements were made, and a circular saw was used to cut the plywood down to size. Three pieces were cut, two to be installed on the bottom shelf, to hold brackets for the reciever rack, and an additional one to be placed along the back of the upper shelf, to keep stored items from falling from the back, and to help create a sleek look.

Plywood was lightly sanded, then 3 coats of spray primer was used to prime the plywood. After drying for 24 hours in a dry enviroment, the bottom of the panel was primed, allowed to dry, and lightly sanded, and black semigloss spray paint was applied in the same fashion.

The top panel the cart came with was attached to the metal frame with several short screws. Several colors of water and oil bsaed stain was tested on a small section of the under side of the panel, but was blotchy and created an undesirable appearence. Thus the top panel was instead left unstained, and finished with a semigloss polyurathane spray to protect the work surface from abuse and to prevent water stains.  

### Plywood Installation:

The outer panel on the lower shelf was able to be attached using wood screws run through the pre-existing holes in the frame. A washer and split lock washer was used to keep the screw from loosening over time. 

Corner braces were used to install the second panel on the lower shelf 2 were installed on the bottom side, in between the 2 plywood panels where the rack was to be installed to create a cleaner look. Wood screws were used to fix the bracket to the plywood, and bolts were installed through drilled holes in the sheetmetal shelf. An additional bracket was installed on the same panel, securing the plywood panel to the bottom of the second shelf. Locktite was used to secure the bolts and to keep vibrations from loosening them. 

### Rack Installation:

[Standard Rack rails](https://www.amazon.com/Gator-Rackworks-Heavy-Steel-GRW-RACKRAIL-04U/dp/B0718XFY1Q/ref=sr_1_6?keywords=rack%2Bmount%2Brails&qid=1664490879&qu=eyJxc2MiOiI0LjQ3IiwicXNhIjoiMy45MiIsInFzcCI6IjMuNTkifQ%3D%3D&sr=8-6&th=1) were purchased from Amazon, and installed onto the previously installed plywood panels.

The design of the frame was such that the corner of the frame would keep the mounting screws on one side of the rack from being easily accessible, so a strip of scrap plywood was cut, and painted so the rack rail would be offset from the plywood panel. This scrap was attached with screws and wood glue. 

The rails were recessed into the cart ~1 inch in order to protect equipment from being damaged during transportation, as well as to allow equipment with protruding controls to be installed in the future.
